# Extract/Inline Notes

The extract note action enables the creation of a new document from a list or a section (header) This involves:

1.  Creating a new file containing the selected content.
2.  Replacing the original selected content with a link to the newly created file.

The reverse operation, known as **inline**, allows you to:

- Inject the content back into the original document, replacing the link and removing the file.

Both operations automatically adjust the header levels as needed to maintain proper document structure.
