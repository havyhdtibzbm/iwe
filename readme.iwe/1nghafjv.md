# Text structure normalization / formatting

LSP offers **auto-formatting**, which typically kicks in when you save your work. This feature helps tidy things up according to the guidelines detailed in this document. Here's what gets cleaned up:

- Uprating link titles to the header of the linked document
- Adjusting header levels to ensure tree structure
- Cleaning up dead links by replacing them with title text
- Updating the numbering of the ordered lists
- Fixing spaces, newlines, and indentations in lists, and much more
